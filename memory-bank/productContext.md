# Product Context

The `bbcode` package provides functionality to convert BBCode formatted text into HTML. The failing tests indicate that the conversion logic is not producing the correct HTML output for certain BBCode tags, specifically for divider, break, and rule tags. The goal is to ensure that the BBCode to HTML conversion is accurate and produces the expected HTML output.
