# Active Context

Currently working on fixing failing tests in `bbcode_to_html_test.go`. The tests are failing for divider, break, and rule tags.
Next steps:
1. Analyze the failing tests and the `bbcode_to_html.go` file.
2. Identify the root cause of the test failures.
3. Implement the necessary changes to fix the conversion logic.
4. Run the tests to verify the fix.
